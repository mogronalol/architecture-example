# Architecture-as-code

This is an example of an architecture diagram produced by Structurizr.

Run `./gradlew run` to generate the diagram via the API, passing in the "api.secret" environment variable. Ask me for this.

The architecture source code:

The example diagram which is produced:

In our case we have a container level diagram.
